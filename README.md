# Code_For_Bachelor_Thesis
This is the accompanying Python code that implements the experiment results in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of my Bachelor Thesis named Robust Wind Farm Layout via Bayesian Optimisation.
The code for Chapter 4 is in the file StableOpt_for_toy_function.ipynb. The code for Chapter 5 of the wake model with theta=0 and 45 is included in the file Wake_Model_0_and_45.ipynb while the code for wake model with theta=15 and 30 is included in the file Wake_Model_15_and_30.ipynb.
